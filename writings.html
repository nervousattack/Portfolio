      <p>We are difficult. Human beings are difficult. We’re difficult to ourselves, we’re difficult to each other. And we are mysteries to ourselves, we are mysteries to each other. One encounters in any ordinary day far more real difficulty than one confronts in the most “intellectual” piece of work. Why is it believed that poetry, prose, painting, music should be less than we are? Why does music, why does poetry have to address us in simplified terms, when if such simplification were applied to a description of our own inner selves we would find it demeaning? I think art has a right—not an obligation—to be difficult if it wishes. And, since people generally go on from this to talk about elitism versus democracy, I would add that genuinely difficult art is truly democratic. And that tyranny requires simplification. This thought does not originate with me, it’s been far better expressed by others.<sup><a href="#fn1-28959" id="fnr1-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup><br/>

      <p class="subtitle">Stuck In the Middle of Nowhere Again</p>

      <p>Most design is an attempt at speaking to masses of people, but rarely is it about creating masses. Contemporary design’s simplified, scattershot grammar is foundational for generalist and populist means for alienation. Blindly following an archaic design ideology that attempts to be unfailingly comprehensive, we have lost our many stylized vocabularies and vernacular to enrich each others’ lives: we’ve become bored by the homogeneity we create, observe, consume, and use and thus feel hopeless and afraid in finding others who may understand our idiosyncrasies. </p>

      <p>Presently, most of society lives at the bottom of an abyss. At the top of this abyss is a brilliantly lit environment where few live and every attempt is made to burn away shadows that may reveal even the slightest deformities in its surfaces. This is further prescribed by the staid world of graphic design which is built upon modernist dogma: the pursuit of clarity, certainty, and purity—pursuits that light offers. These are principles to maintain the status quo and the belief in hierarchical systems. Modernism’s constant blinding light, which is decidedly white, focuses our attention on expectations and ethos we presume to be true, creating spaces and mentalities of never-ending sameness and thus dreadfulness. Oligarchies want to portray the abyss we’ve collectively been digging as something that needs to be combated so that we may turn toward and step into their white lights in order to be blinded and separated from each other.</p>

      <p>A designer’s first step to any new design brief should be rewriting it to fit the desires of its audience, not its client. Therefore, if we take a step back and reevaluate the darkness of this abyss, we can consider it’s blurry boundary as a gentle entry point—allowing one to ease themselves through its gradient threshold—as well as the lack of light as an opportunity for partaking in non-hierarchical structures. With this in mind, darkness can be understood as a space without the anxiety of absolute limits: one has the opportunity to style themselves without mockery, fail without the implications of disability, and have a discourse without the burning pressure of a spotlight, all while giving one the confidence to be uncertain. Not only that, but the digging and scraping that increases the abyss’s depth needs to be recognized as a collective action to help prevent the lights of our ever-advancing surveillance-driven world from burning away our mysteries. The reverberating din a signal to each other that we are somewhere nearby in the darkness.</p>

      <p>What I’m proposing is that darkness’s disorientation and flattening of hierarchies does not correlate exclusively to oppression. Stuck within capitalism, design will never be ethical or save the world, and there are more important societal factors to be aware of and advocate for.<sup><a href="#fn2-28959" id="fnr2-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Yet while all seems hopeless with the state of current affairs, it’s important that we continue to examine the ways in which designers can help push and pull ideas and bodies into a swaying of cognitive expression, giving form to the ethereal winds and volatile tides of cultural discourse. By inciting moods—instead of beliefs or goals towards “solutions”—through the use of the esoteric, we can stimulate the tenacity to coalesce masses and bring people beyond the limits of their self and self-preservationist impulses.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">Fiction Friction</p>

      <p>Like many people, music is a vital source of inspiration in my life. For me, extreme aesthetics within music have been a profound influence, particularly aspects of black/death/doom metal, hardcore punk, drum and bass, and even ambient drone (“extreme” for those listeners that don’t have the patience). I’ve had discussions with people who don’t understand how I can listen to or stomach such noise, yet all I can ever tell them is that the screaming, sloppy craftsmanship, toilet bowl production, and chaotic (or lack of) rhythm are all somehow calming. Thematically or lyrically, a majority of this music revolves around the debilitating feelings that stem from the nothingness or uncertainty of our lives—feelings that the abyss we live in can incite. But extreme auditory aesthetics create <em>something</em> with the nothingness of uncertainty, constantly pursuing the capture of uncertainty’s form, weight, and sound while still letting it continue to be nothingness. In other words, as theorist Eugene Thacker writes, “the sound of the abyss is not silence, or quiet, or noise, but <em>unsound</em>. That which is unsound—like a building, or a mind—is always unstable, continually about to collapse. ... An unsound is akin, perhaps, to the term ‘unknowing’ ... an undoing or unraveling, denoting both the negation of the ground of knowledge, as well as the paradoxical apprehension of an absolute limit.”<sup><a href="#fn3-28959" id="fnr3-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

      <p>Extreme aesthetics within music are an entanglement of that which is distressed, complicated, unstable and unknown. Any attempt to “unravel” this knot will be met with friction and even more uncertainty. But this friction slows one’s thoughts, forcing one to notice <em>something</em> or <em>someone</em>, and thus reveal expressions of style. It also acts like a form of meditation. The aesthetic complexity of such work forces one to linger in its presence, and as we wallow in the pinnacle of its extreme din we are able to reframe the darkness we live in and the nothingness we feel as spaces in which pain can be acknowledged and pacified. For example, the minimal beat and synths in Cardi B’s <em>Bodak Yellow</em> carve out a void so dark that its eeriness allows Cardi B to confidently rap about her foothold on this chaotic world, letting those words be the infectious element for listeners to use as they navigate the auditory void. In a visual sense, while driving at night, voids of light between street lamps on city freeways and rural backroads transform our routine (sunlit) routes into a strobe-light-like jigsaw puzzle. Similar to sensory deprivation, such voids are a place or moment to reshape feelings of uselessness as motivation and disorientation as possibility. Voids don’t impose themselves on one’s space. They are climates outside the conventional framing of a work that instill aimless direction beyond the limits of stationary contemplation and guide us toward definitive feelings about the spaces we stand upon and occupy. Voids allow a landscape of commonality to populate.</p>

      <p>If design is a tool or a vessel for inquiry, then it must utilize the friction and spatiality of entanglements. If anything, it’s undemocratic to design things that are meant to be a passive presence (i.e., “invisible design”). Easily digestible work is mind-numbing for designers to make and for audiences to consider. Friction and its inherit difficulty help to arouse consciousness. In my own practice, I’ve used a methodology for many years that overwhelmingly decays images into high-contrast visual entanglements. Some of the original sources’ forms are still recognizable and therefore allow moments to reassess spaces within the new disfigurement that hopefully evoke a desire to renew endeavors that once seemed lost for both myself and, more importantly, my audience. </p>

      <p>Uncertainty doesn’t need to be solved by design, rather design needs to give it form so that its presence can be embraced. Through the use of disorientation and disfigurement, the creation of uncertain landscapes and voids allows an audience to compare and relate their views of the world with how an artist or designer sees. Taking this a step further, understanding others’ ways of looking is what creates friendship. Abandoning an oligarchy’s pursuit of certainty, clarity, and purity for messiness and inexperience would be seen, in the words of curator Eloise Sweetman, as an appeal for intimacy. And this appeal would finally dissolve the preconceived notion that intimacy is a private affair and instead establish intimacy as the actuality that it is: a public affair that welcomes all encounters and teachings.<sup><a href="#fn4-28959" id="fnr4-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup> By subduing the pressures of perfection and cleanliness, and allowing the weirdness of normalcy to be reassuring—just like the extreme aesthetics of music—we can engender solidarity within the abyss’s darkness. Knowing that you belong to something, that you connect with something, is the essence of authenticity and an aspect that builds the confidence to investigate.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">The Light at the End of the Tunnel Is...</p>

      <p>Inherent within darkness is an inclusive behavior based around the human right to experiment: to find and understand who you are as a human being. Making darkness’s traits ubiquitous means constructs currently considered “alternative” in our capitalist and sedated world would be able to slowly devour staid language and behavior and replace them with their (“alternative”) vernacular. </p>

      <p>Night, for example, is one ubiquitous form of darkness. However, it isn’t a reoccurring moment meant for hiding or masking. Instead it encircles, for it must be understood that light and its negative effects are a necessary component of night’s mystique. To completely extinguish light is to do the same to cognitive expression. We need the ember of a once raging flame, pale blue moonlight, and red blinking aircraft warning lights on the horizon to arouse our consciousness in darkness. The pulsing gradient boundary where darkness and light clash is an interzone of oscillating sincerity, and its fragility from waxing and waning means it’s mutable for anyone whether they have expertise with the subject or are naively interested in participating.</p>

      <p>So how can individuals find their way into such interzones? Like the sensory deprivation sensations caused by extreme aesthetics in music, darkness evokes disorientation and puts one at risk of stumbling. When one stumbles, either physically or metaphorically, it is, in the simplest of terms, a form of grotesqueness but also vulnerability. This also means it is a moment of recognition or correction for one’s behavior. In the same way that we would stumble and land somewhere we normally wouldn’t have, the border of graphics and interfaces need to ooze, rather than frame, their content. When grotesque interests and the vulnerability in crafting and sharing those interests oozes, an imaginary mesh or constellation of esoteric spaces begins to germinate and self-preservationist trends erode. This constellation isn’t to make everything neat and orderly, for those are not the conditions our society has ever been in nor should they be. The purity of light-driven design has built a staid environment that evokes a “paranoid obsession with order [that] tries to reduce the horizon to repetition, belonging and identity.”<sup><a href="#fn5-28959" id="fnr5-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Quoting theorist Franco ‘Bifo’ Berardi, “in this condition of panic, reason becomes unable to master the flow of events or to process... A schizophrenic mode spreads across the social mind ... as an over-inclusive mode of interpretation.” In other words, this panic can be understood as the reason many people act, argue, or vote against the betterment of their own lives and the lives of those in similar situations: it’s stirring confusion around class consciousness. The proposed oozing constellation is a means to to encourage the acceptance of disorientation as a form of navigation through the panic of the information age. As we curiously stumble as a form of action from one node (i.e., one person or group’s esotericism) of the constellation to another, we can begin to dismantle anxiety and promote listening in intimate public spaces. </p>

      <p>This oozing is also something more than just a means to seep into works or structures that surround it. An image in flux is a fragile image, not built upon the ironclad gridded structures of modernism and therefore always at risk of decaying or shattering. And it’s important to understand this ephemerality as something more than a disappearance or removal of something. Newer generations will no longer navigate or see the world as we do now, which is already prevalent in how present day youth navigate and repurpose social media platforms. Timelessness does not exist, and notions of permanence only cause us to compete against one another in superficial and binary ways. In terms of design, light-motivated work has distorted authenticity’s definition to be about individualism which tragically results in isolationism, convincing us that it is more important to be seen than to exist. Designers that strive to make “timeless” and “invisible” work, or are afraid to show their hand in their work, advocate for oppression upon their audiences and themselves. How are designers supposed to present our identities as not explicitly fixed by capital if the work they contribute punctuates and blends in with austere environments? What does it say of the profession that enables the elitist binary qualifications of likability and scalability that dismiss so many voices? Timeless measures only create a more brilliant light that burns away the shadows that reveal the cracks in the foundation of our physical, digital, and government infrastructure. </p>

      <p>Consider artist Rammellzee’s “gothic futurist” work. Made mostly from the trash of New York City, the eccentric, eclectic, and esoteric sensibilities of Rammellzee’s work—from graffiti, to music, to costumes, to performance art—stem from his parasitic attempt to burrow into the decay that capitalism has caused and reassess how we can use it or build within it for civic means. In regard to this idea of “abandonment and reclamation” in Rammellzee’s work, illustrator Zhu Bajiee inspiringly writes:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>To walk through the urban environment with the eye and mind of a graffiti writer is [to] dismantle the intended organisation of space, the town planners drawings are sliced up and reconfigured into an entirely new landscape. The ignored undersides of bridges become focal points, boundaries become access points, the landscape becomes a map of vantage-points where graffiti may be seen and concealments where a writer may be undisturbed. Opportunities for expression open up within ignored, abandoned and liminal spaces. The tags, throwups and pieces left behind by other writers become markers, not only a patina that indicates safe-spaces for illicit writing, but a dynamic system of rivalry and community that weaves its way through the otherwise static canyons of urban space that in the dominant culture exist only as dead-space between land-banks, glass and concrete investment portfolios, the wreckage of broken machines for living in and zones of social control. ... The substrate—the surface ... be it the A-train or a tenement block is an alien artefact, designed and created entirely outside the social sphere of those who inherit and occupy the space. Graffiti, and weaponised intergalactic graffiti at that, reclaims the impersonal, tyrannical object—the building—destroys it's authoritarian purpose and transforms it into an entirely new narrative.<sup><a href="#fn6-28959" id="fnr6-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Or take the See Red Women’s Workshop posters that some would consider low-vernacular and ephemeral. Yet these facets established their publishing practice as a co-operative designer/audience model, rather than an austere designer/client model. Publisher and educator Eva Weinmayr defines such a model as not “the end of a process during which consolidated thoughts and enquiries are put into a final brochure, book or leaflet.” Instead, she proposes that we should </p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>look at publishing more as a way to initiate a social process, a social space, where meaning is collectively established in the collaborative creation of a publication. From this perspective, all of a sudden publishing is not a document of pre-defined cognitions. Publishing becomes a tool to make discoveries. ... I’d like to think of printed publications, posters or zines as not necessarily the end product trying to convince anyone of anything, but rather as “working towards establishing conditions for the co-production of meaning.” ... where skills are exchanged and knowledge co-produced—in public.<sup><a href="#fn7-28959" id="fnr7-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>In many ways the slight hint of naivety—and therefore sincerity—in the work of the See Red Women’s Workshop was an invitation to “non-designers” to participate in the collective’s poster making process but also in the more important women’s rights discourse the collective was trying to influence. They presented woman’s rights as a malleable opportunity for <em>anyone</em> to activate and transform. </p>

      <p>But it should be noted that fragility and the flattening of hierarchies should not be confused with minimalism. Successful minimalism is the <em>result</em> of a design process, not something you aim to do from the outset. Furthermore, the default conditions that are usually prevalent within minimalist design are not low forms—they stem from luxury design’s obsession with sleekness and that it is next to cleanliness and cleanliness is next to godliness. Not all instances of sleekness or minimalism are unethical, but when they manifest as luxury—lacking a need for cognition—they become inhuman and inhumane. Default sleekness makes both designers and their audience feel flawed for expressing or sharing their esoteric interests, and diminishes the motivating forces of craftsmanship. It is an austere attempt at homogenization, as musician Ian Svenonius argues:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>The hit A&amp;E TV show <em>Hoarders</em> identifies people with things as socially malignant, grotesque, primitive, dirty, bizarre. In a word: poor. Apple has turned the world upside down in making possessions a symbol of poverty and having nothing a signifier of wealth and power. ... The shaming of targeted “hoarders” is intended specifically to cajole, bully, and embarrass the population into giving up everything they have; not just possessions but ideas, ethics, rights to ownership (both intellectual and otherwise), privacy, decency, justice, fair treatment, and human rights. In the Apple-internet age we are expected to surrender absolutely everything; anything less is filthy and deranged “hoarding.”<sup><a href="#fn8-28959" id="fnr8-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>As we dig the abyss deeper, we need to keep our imaginations and urgency to inquire alive and well, and a hoarder mentality would do just that. From the trivial to the monumental and the bizarre to the chic, we need <em>things</em> to create entanglements and noise and potential and authenticity and consciousness. Our connections to these myriad of things means we always have a source that can begin a conversation or a creation of some kind. And there is always the route of appropriation. Avoiding unethical cultural appropriation, the reworking/remixing definition of appropriation is about picking up the loose threads and cold trails of other artists’ and designers’ interests, research, and investigations and continuing that work in your own voice with your own intentions and opinions.<sup><a href="#fn9-28959" id="fnr9-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup> If one were to replace traditional hierarchical systems with hoarded graphic representations of personal memories and affections, then an inclination to not recreate visual archetypes could be enacted.</p>

      <p>As theorist Mark Fisher asserts, “innovation in popular culture has overwhelmingly come from the working class.”<sup><a href="#fn10-28959" id="fnr10-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">10</a></sup> When the sterile sensibilities of light-driven design lock “popular culture into repetition,” it can be understood as a “systematic and sustained attack on working class life.”<sup><a href="#fn11-28959" id="fnr11-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">11</a></sup> The endeavor of remixing memories and affections—whether that be cartoons from your childhood, trips to the mall, being locked in your room listening to records, hiking in a forest, eating at a restaurant, running errands, or noticing cracks in the sidewalk—is an exercise in being mindful of the aesthetic and esoteric devices we are constantly ingesting and digesting. Integrating such devices in hegemonic works opens up the potential for audiences to discover portals to designers’ “digestive tracts” and establish personal and egalitarian connections through the acknowledgment of similar experiences or interests. This moment of connection is the aforementioned interzone: our memories and affections the darkness that encircles the light-driven dogma that proclaims these things as worthless and unappealing. It’s a moment to decelerate one’s behavior to notice and consider the many routes that can be taken towards human connection rather than being pressured into hastily consuming “solutions.” It’s an attempt at including, rather than suppressing, a myriad of voices other than just those of designers—a reminder that society exists, and things that are considered alien, weird, or even banal can be foundational for engendering political and sociological discourse with people that need to be a part of such conversations. By entangling those visual remixes with the chaos that stems from politics, architecture, technology, and other constructs within our daily lives, designers and their invigorated audience can address these indisputable chaotic and negative facts and clumsily contort these truths not into hyperboles but into constant reminders of what we’re fighting for and against.</p>

      <p class="subtitle">The Future of What</p>

      <p>It is vital to arouse consciousness around light-producing and capitalist constructs, and action through and within darkness engenders such possibilities. But the aforementioned dark traits and approaches must not be considered exclusively as an outsider endeavor. Being an outsider is passé because light-producing constructs can easily whitewash and isolate the message or entity of the outsider. We are stuck under capitalism, and designers are more often than not forced to work under problematic corporations for financial needs. Therefore, as capitalism forces designers to be insiders, such roles need to embraced for their ability to confront hierarchy and power and destroy plans for marginalization. Embrace the fact that such roles, especially as a collective, are unavoidable to the end goals of capitalism. When it comes to molding the future, the question of “what if” is less powerful than the question of “what now.” We must not mistake our talk of alternative art spaces and thinking as our <em>only</em> means of political action.</p>

      <p>The work of designers should be a space that allows us to lose ourselves in each other, drifting from one convergence to another. And in the simplest of terms, esotericism is the driving force that leads us to those connections. Generality does not. I’m not proposing to use specific imagery or language, political or otherwise, to coalesce masses since actions will always speak louder than words.<sup><a href="#fn12-28959" id="fnr12-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">12</a></sup> We as people, as a society, are culture makers, and designers are simply people with the awareness to formulate that culture into something visually coherent. The design mentality of designing <em>for</em> someone or something more often than not creates elitist, exclusive, and homogenized “solutions.” To consider design that is made as an “expression of ideas and as language”—capturing feelings of “pleasure, desire, [and] uselessness” as the encouragement to walk “through the world with your eyes open”—we can begin to engender possibilities of designing <em>with</em> others.<sup><a href="#fn13-28959" id="fnr13-28959" title="see footnote" class="footnote">13</a></sup> Rather than relying on light-producing empathy, whose passivity to simply recognize a situation or feeling may subconsciously absolve us of responsibility or urgency to take action, designing with others is how we access dark-centric <em>compassion</em> to give weight and value to personal or societal concerns. Combined with the pulsing interzones of various subcultures, our senses swell and lead us to ask questions, particularly about the present, in order to better address the future of spaces, objects, identities, semiotics, and semantics. With our everyday occurrences, activities, and affections configured as vulnerable graphic entanglements, solidarity will no longer equal conformity.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="content">

      <p>As a service industry, who does design serve? Most designers would say that the beginning of any brief is identifying the audience. But briefs come from clients—entities that, indirectly or not, dictate the goals and ethics of an employer (i.e., agency or studio) or designer. Most workplace decisions are for client retention and acquisition, and the needs of the general public are not a factor, especially when they are reduced to generalized, fictional characters in case studies.</p>

      <p>Mainstream design—that includes all of its many disciplines such as architecture, industrial design, and graphic design—more often than not, does not promote the human right to experiment or experience. It promotes conformity to client brands and products through strategies based on alienation (read: individualism) and scalability. Are all clients wealth-hoarding and evil? No. But as a service industry, it’s difficult for working designers to create an alternative model for their labor and livelihood when that means having to dismantle a dual-employer system (middlemen agencies and/or the high-paying corporate clients those agencies report to). </p>

      <p>Worker cooperatives are one such alternative: they share control, ownership, and profits of the workplace and the products of their labor; encourage all workers to help shape the direction of the group; create accountability for poor decisions of leadership; and build a sense of community from mutually respecting relationships, helping to dismantle sexism and racism in the workplace.<sup><a href="#fn1-14465" id="fnr1-14465" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup> But instances of worker co-ops are more prominent in product industries, not service industries. Like artists or musicians, these product industries make something, share it, and hope for monetary or live-setting support. In such cases, an employer, and the hierarchy that comes with them, isn’t necessary to produce the goods you want to share with the world. With traditional service industry models of design—which are deeply rooted in capitalism—goods are made but they are for another entity to sell and profit from. And for designers to simply make things for themselves without clients relegates their work to that of an artist. And while an artist’s work is vital for fueling imagination and new realities, it doesn’t have the means to literally create them on a massive scale. Which leads to the larger issue, that the public still needs <em>things</em>: shelter, transportation, journalism, medicine, and the list goes on and on. There are necessities that require design investments to explore all of the pros, cons, and use-cases for a myriad of demographics and territories. Design as a discipline simply cannot end. </p>

      <p>However, a majority of agencies and studios root themselves in major metropolitan cities, and young graduates flock to those same cities in the hopes of finding work. Anything “cool” or established will find itself in one of these places. Sometimes these cool establishments pay a living-wage, and sometimes they don’t. In the simplest of terms, cool and established clients tell us what to consume, how to consume, and when to consume, and designers are crafting the infrastructure for that behavior, making sure it stays timelessly defined and defended. In a way, designers are like police, and the questions of “Who do you protect? Who do you serve?” lead to the answers of private property and those that are wealthy. This leaves miles of territory, and the people within it, ignored, abandoned, and forgotten. There is also the issue of celebrity designers and starchitects, regardless of where they are based in the world, winning hegemonic design proposals simply because of their notoriety or wealth. This leads to a flamboyant infiltration of a place that is in need of dedicated collaboration. But what if designers uprooted from these metropolitan design bubbles and went literally anywhere else? And what if they kept uprooting themselves? What if designers and their studio entities became nomads? </p>

      <p>Nomadism could be the concept that allows entities in the service industry of design to be worker-owned. By moving place to place, the roots of capitalism could slowly be cut as other constructs bring the profession a greater purpose and a better livelihood. At each new place, designers or studio entities don’t wait for clients to come to them. They instead canvas neighborhoods and environments, asking questions and listening to the concerns of those who live there. Denizens<sup><a href="#fn2-14465" id="fnr2-14465" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup> become “clients,” but more importantly they are constituents determining the things <em>they</em> need. Designers then take that feedback and build products or happenings that they then test. As thoughts change, activities change. With that change comes modification, and more testing, until both designers and denizens can live with the results. Responsibility becomes something more than hitting a deadline or completing a to-do list. The measure of success isn’t based on branding a territory or speaking for others, but rather the compassionate and generative behavior engendered from understanding who lives where, why they live there, and what they live for. When the designer’s role becomes uncertain due to the unfamiliarly of non-hierarchical workings, the search for meaning looks to the places ignored by (plutocracies’) normative visions of progress.</p>

      <p>A quick online search of “nomadic design” reveals images of contemporary takes on upcycled products, furniture, and architecture, similar to things found in James Hennessey and Victor Papanek’s 1973 book <em>Nomadic Furniture</em>. My proposal for nomadic design, however, is not based on upcycling or frugalness alone. The things international design agencies attempt with large budgets still have a place within nomadic design—if anything, nomadic design is about reclaiming such large-scale initiatives in the name of societal necessity and collaboration. Beyond just the <em>what</em> and the <em>how</em> of making things, nomadic design is about the importance of circulative conversation in relation to identity and belonging. Yet it obviously cannot simply be a switch that designers flip one day, terminating their studio leases or quitting their agency jobs and then hitting the open road. And capitalism isn’t disappearing anytime soon that the need for monetary funding won’t be necessary. Especially in the United States, government funding for an “arts” initiative will be difficult to lobby for. But I do think one sector has the means to prove and iron out the logistics and importance of nomadic design, that being education.</p>

      <p>Nomadic design education<sup><a href="#fn3-14465" id="fnr3-14465" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup> would be no different than the aforementioned professional scenarios: the classroom is the world and the assignments are collaborating with denizens to survive in that world. After a year or two of introductory technical and historical courses, students and instructors would begin to work with local cooperatives or non-profits. Starting from scratch, students would learn to assess their needs and values and then build their own means of transportation, shelter, and production—the collective action of the cohort determining how far the school travels for each academic year. But more importantly, this DIY culture and mentality helps to build a lifestyle, not just skills, after graduation: a lifestyle in which community life is a resource and a commitment. When students see and experience the deterioration and oppression brought upon this world, their professional views come to recognize the systems, rather than the surfaces, that need to be reassessed or dismantled. Nomadism turns a <em>school</em> into a mentality rather than a place and instills that mindset within students after they graduate.</p>

      <p>In her book <em>The Mushroom at the End of the World</em>, Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing writes a unique argument for how fungi growth and commerce can be the basis to human survival in a world of capitalist destruction. Fitting for the case of nomadic design she asks, “How does a gathering become a ‘happening,’ that is, greater than a sum of its parts?” Her answer is </p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>contamination. We are contaminated by our encounters; they change who we are as we make way for others. ... Everyone carries a history of contamination; purity is not an option. One value of keeping precarity in mind is that it makes us remember that changing with circumstances is the stuff of survival.<sup><a href="#fn4-14465" id="fnr4-14465" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>In the professional world, the consequences of a nomadic designer’s actions reveal the political nature of everything we do as a society. Presently, political design aesthetics fail because they are just a veneer or facade applied to a symptom of the cause. It does not dismantle the isolation of the design profession from society nor the divide between constituents and policy makers. Nomadic design is a political act that does not—or rather cannot, when face-to-face with fellow denizens—accept the surface level as the only space of action. Every nomadic initiative is a rehearsal—or contamination, as Tsing suggests—before it becomes a product or happening. With designers as the participants in these contagious rehearsals, the misguided ethos of “design thinking” or “problem solving”—remote or tourist-like approaches—are replaced with the ambition to understand and the dedication to follow through: desires to be entangled not just with people but also the various lifestyles and livelihoods that come with those people. And when the worker cooperative principles of nomadic design remove the profiteering middleman from policy-making—while also removing employers—the production and implementation of societal needs can be more easily addressed without direct action needing to trickle down through a hierarchy. Thus a true democracy is represented in workflows.</p>

      <p>Thomas Spijkerman, director of the Reinventing Daily Life temporary master program at the Sandberg Instituut, suggests:</p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>What would happen if the functions that have traditionally belonged to the domain of the arts were no longer assigned exclusively to the arts, but treated as something that we expect of everybody in society? A collectively borne responsibility for creating an inspiring, inclusive, honest, imaginative society. Based on the idea, or rather the confident belief, that everyone is in fact capable of making a contribution based on their own expertise. ... In that scenario the artist is no longer one of the chosen few. No longer the romantic, unconventional, autonomous ideal of times gone by. She is no different from the doctor or the firefighter and knows her place in the whole.<sup><a href="#fn5-14465" id="fnr5-14465" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Nomadic principles bring design to this egalitarian level that Spijkerman speaks of by forcing the profession to be cross-disciplinary, cross-cultural, and community-centric. As one travels from place to place, making and establishing human relations, a purposeful network forms and the work designers build and publish becomes the infrastructure for the transfer of resources. And just like with the nomadic education model, this work determines the reach and longevity of a designer’s practice. This isn’t mindless, narcissistic infiltration. With designers’ feet always to the ground—and no base, headquarters, or web presence to run and hide behind—accountability comes to the forefront of the profession if design entities leave fellow denizens to clean up misguided failures. </p>

      <p>At this point I must again acknowledge that when design no longer serves employers and instead addresses denizens’ societal needs, it will lack the monetary funding necessary to sustain itself in our presently capitalist society. While our goals are for a healthy and egalitarian anti-capitalist society, we are unfortunately nowhere near fulfilling such goals. Therefore we must consider how nomadic design functions in our present world <em>and</em> how it can transition us to the future we want. The previously proposed nomadic education model can certainly prove nomadic design’s worth, but how do we introduce sustainability to the professional model under capitalism? A newfound sense of accountability could place design under government programming as a public service, giving it a dedicated budget and regulations. There are pros and cons to such government programs—as state-owned does not necessarily equate to anti-capitalist—but socialist ideas could be introduced, particularly at local-level assemblies that designers would attend as policy-makers. </p>

      <p>Another opportunity within a capitalist world would be to define nomadic design entities as <em>clans</em>, in which manufactured goods—such as clothing, books, furniture, foods, et cetera—are an extension of their practice, based on their nomadic research, findings, and proposals. Yes, this is similar to a present day <em>brand</em>, but the distinction stems from Deleuze and Guattari’s concept of “Schizophrenia,” </p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>a positive process [that] is inventive connection, expansion rather than withdrawal. Its twoness is a relay to a multiplicity ... Not aimlessly. Experimentally. ... “Nomad thought” does not lodge itself in the edifice of an ordered interiority; it moves freely in an element of exteriority. It does not repose on identity; it rides difference.<sup><a href="#fn6-14465" id="fnr6-14465" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>A clan is an inclusive moving mass that “rather than reflecting the world, [is] immersed in a changing state of things.”<sup><a href="#fn7-14465" id="fnr7-14465" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup> In comparison, a brand sells nothing more than a logo of its time for the sake of privatized expansion. This distinction also begs the question: why do we need to sell our ideas to a brand like Nike, whose only use of such ideas is to make an even greater profit, when designers can just make the shoes we want? Of course nomenclature does not equal a living wage, but by building local markets upon clans’ non-hierarchical and democratic instincts—serving our needs <em>and wants</em>—can we actually destroy institutionalized markets and change what it means to survive in both a capitalist and anti-capitalist world? Quoting Tsing again, </p>

      <blockquote>
      <p>In popular American fantasies, survival is all about saving oneself by fighting off others. The “survival” featured in U.S. television shows or alien-plant stories is a synonym for conquest and expansion. Please open yourself to another usage ... that staying alive—for every species—requires livable collaboration. Collaboration means working across difference, which leads to contamination.<sup><a href="#fn8-14465" id="fnr8-14465" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Although societal needs are at the forefront of nomadic design practices, the embodiment of Tsing’s collaborative definition of survival does not abolish visual explorations of attraction nor visceral expressions. Such facets are vital to the entanglement of life, and those conversations run parallel to those about necessity so that the two may rearrange and influence each other. Nomadic design leaves no rock unturned because, above all else, it is an urgency to shift discourses (design or otherwise) from alienated identity to generative belonging.</p>

  <div id="Swati" class="item">
      <div class="itemdivider"></div>
    <div class="details">
      <div class="name">Swati Piparsania (foreword)</div>
      <div class="year">April 2018</div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">

      <p>From their book <em>are we human?</em>, Beatriz Colomina and Mark Wigley define design as</p>

      <blockquote>
      defense. Most theories of design present the human as under some kind of threat that needs to be urgently countered by design. The defense is seen to draw from some quality deeply embedded in the human, as if design itself is the natural human way to preserve the human. The most radical attempts to reshape the human are typically carried out under this guise of reinforcing and protecting the human. Design is a paradoxical gesture that changes the human in order to protect it.
      </blockquote>

      <p>This definition, although never stated in such a critical manner, is most often considered “good design” within the disciplines of design because it’s never challenged to be any other way. But Swati Piparsania’s work does the opposite of Colomina and Wigley’s definition and that’s why her work is so vital. Rather than protect humans, her designed objects expose humans for who they are, and this vulnerability leads to a discourse in which users—rather than designers—lead the discussion about what is needed, what is wrong, and what is useful in our lives. In a way, Piparsania’s objects make room for each of us to be wrong, giving us opportunities to reflect on how we each participate in our world’s built environments.</p>

      <p>While Piparsania’s work may lack conclusive or detailed scientific research, her work is still rooted very much in reality because it is based on what we all survey in this world and either have become oblivious to or believe we don’t possess the means to make a change. Yet her objects are also fictional because, like any great work of fiction, they spark the imagination within a user to reframe or rethink what could be done with something so inconceivably wrong. Furthermore, unlike most designed products that are marketed as necessities, Piparsania’s objects are participatory, letting you decided how you want to behave rather than modernist and Silicon Valley ethos and systems telling you how to feel or do something.</p>

      <p>Author Ursula Le Guin, known for her fictional writings, once remarked that “all of us have to learn how to invent our lives, make them up, imagine them. We need to be taught these skills; we need guides to show us how. If we don’t, our lives get made up for us by other people.” Piparsania’s <em>Gridded Walking</em> object is one such guide for us to fulfill our lives, as Le Guin states, in a constant inventive and imaginative way. The object allows up to four standing users to bear their weight against four quadrants of the object to create a mobile conversation pit (the potted plant as a centerpiece also helps to brighten the mood)—nothing needs to be held, and only the conversation of the four users can guide the entrapped group in a new direction. But it’s not until you’ve used <em>Gridded Walking</em> that you realize how it reverses our natural modern inclination to lean back and walk away from a conversation into a form of comfort, letting our egos slide off our relaxed shoulders as we giggle and embrace how we communicate to one another. It’s like a potato sack race, but with eight legs bound together and no end-goal in sight.</p>

      <p>Piparsania’s <em>Take Your Plant For A Walk</em> object series takes <em>Gridded Walking</em>’s awkward moments and applies them solely to individual use cases. By taking your houseplant for a walk outside, like we would with a pet dog or even a toddler, we further let our egos and facades drop and, in a way, become confident fools. But foolishness should not be confused with ignorance because the absurdity and humor of this object and activity allow us to be open and vulnerable, leading to design conversations that aren’t about the need to protect or isolate ourselves <em>from</em> each other, but rather that we need to protect each other with compassion.</p>

      <p><em>Ramps</em>, Piparsania’s most recent work, bring these ideas of awareness, activity, and absurdity together once more. Low-level pastel pink wooden ramps liter the floors of a space and suggest that we walk upon them. They are a playground of sorts for adults—although just as much as for children—built upon an invitation of curiosity. Walking over, across, or even within these ramps, one comes to the conclusion, “Does haste really improve our lives?” As Ferris Bueller once said, “Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” By fabricating inclined trails of the less traveled, filled with hinderances and obstructions, Piparsania is building both inspiration and resilience in how we approach the mundane, tragic, dire, and beautiful moments of our lives. </p>

      <p>Piparsania’s objects are not representations—<em>they are</em> exactly as we function in spaces and in society. They critique society by letting us behave exactly as we normally would. We are not actor’s wearing these objects. We are not guinea pigs using these objects. We are ourselves, no more and no less. Moreover, and most importantly, Piparsania’s objects are more than just objects—they are a commentary not necessarily on our lives but on design’s overbearing assumption that it knows best. They are reimaginings of how we can construct the built environment around us, with laypeople’s opinions and views holding equal value to designers’ intuition. </p>

  <div id="Britt" class="item">
      <div class="itemdivider"></div>
    <div class="details">
      <div class="name">Britt Gudas (Review)</div>
      <div class="year">February 2019</div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">

    <p>Based on the furniture of the Shakers—a Christian sect from the 18th century in England that attempted to separate themselves from the “outside world” and to create a heaven-on-earth—Britt Gudas’ elongated gothic table is the narrative of a failed seance. Shaped like a coffin lid, it tells us what modernism never understood about itself, that, like the Shakers, modernist design is a celibate practice, lacking “mystery and emotion, [and] a little too frank about the limits of human nature [while] never preparing us for our eventual end.”<sup><a href="#fn1-13725" id="fnr1-13725" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Therefore, this is a subversive attempt by Gudas to turn the mundanity of zealous modernism-before-modernism designs into something uncanny and possessive. </p>

    <p>The <em>uncanny</em> we must understand in the German and Freudian sense, as the <em>Unheimliche</em>—the ‘unhomely’—and therefore as something that “isn’t new or strange, but something that was long familiar to the psyche and was estranged from it only through being repressed.”<sup><a href="#fn2-13725" id="fnr2-13725" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The table’s Gothic nature stems from theorist Jack Halberstam’s definition of the Gothic being a “rhetorical style and narrative structure designed to produce fear and desire within the reader [...] emanating from the vertiginous excess of meaning [...] a rhetorical extravagance that produces, quite simply, too much.”<sup><a href="#fn3-13725" id="fnr3-13725" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup> </p>

    <p>The table is somewhat familiar, but its short width makes it difficult to conjure and imagine what could be placed on top of it therefore attributing an eerie aura to it. Is this a tiny dining table? An uncomfortable pub table? Most would say no to anything other than a foyer table to place decorative objects such as candles or a vase with flowers—in other words, a table to be forgotten off to the side of some room of some building. Maybe that’s because a one-to-one design of the Shakers' boring celibate culture makes it practically useless in the present day. Yet we can’t deny that this table is all dolled-up in gothic tropes, and considering goths are not known for their utilitarian tastes or interests, let’s <em>force</em> it to be something for a goth—a seance table. </p>

    <p>Completely submerged in glossy black resin, the coffin lid shape of the tabletop becomes a reflecting pool in which during a seance the beveled edges are the threshold that distort your reflection of the physical world and enclose the center of the tabletop which perfectly reflects your desired otherworldly image. This doubling of ourselves reinforces the uncanniness and eeriness in this work. But a seance for what? With dust particles drowned and embedded in the resin, this table implies that it reflects on the ‘then’ and ‘there’ as opposed to the ‘here’ and ‘now’. According to historian Celeste Olalquiga:</p>

    <blockquote>
    <p>The dust that falls on modern things is the decay of the aura, the decomposition of a previous era that, like the tons of shells and detritus that continuously sink to the ocean bottom, creates a new layer of sediment. The dust of modernity, a mix of boredom and death, is the most tangible aspect of the new historical time, a thin patina of shattered moments remains after the frenzy of multiplication has subsided or moved away. [...] Dust is what connects the dreams of yesteryear with the touch of nowadays.<sup><a href="#fn4-13725" id="fnr4-13725" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In addition, the legs of the table are entangled with vine-like ornamentation almost reminiscent of dust’s cousin, ash, or more specifically in this case, volcanic ash and all of its pulverized rock, minerals, and glass. This classifies the table not as an object but as an environment—an open field in which all sound seems to fade except the faint tapping of falling dust and ash. Again, all of this states that the table has a history or rather is built upon histories, consuming them to feed its dark abyss like the swallowing gravitational pull of a black hole. And this is where the gothic fear comes into play. Standing and hovering over this tall reflective table, your (floating) head and ceiling background are littered with the permanently drowned dust, this otherworldly reflection is permeated with the past meaning it is attempting to turn your physical presence into an out-of-body experience—you watching yourself watch yourself in this black hole reflecting pool. With the table as an environment, the intake of our reflection becomes so “vertiginous” that we inevitably are twisted and warped into the objects meant to rest on this table. </p>

    <p>Does this mean the table is some sort of capitalist structure for objectifying us? Yes and no, for I believe this table is attempting to deconstruct pop culture’s exhibition of desire. Unraveling Jean Baudrillard’s book <em>Seduction</em> and the statement “if God is masculine, idols are always feminine,” theorist Mark Fisher states, “the traditional problem for the male in pop culture has been dealing with a desire for the unattainable [...] The complementary difficulty for the female has been to come to terms with not being what the male wants. The Object knows that what she has does not correspond with what the Subject lacks.”<sup><a href="#fn5-13725" id="fnr5-13725" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup> However, all is not lost as Fisher points out that the pop star and goth artist Siouxsie Sioux (from the band Siouxsie and the Banshees) dealt with this dilemma by making art out of her own objectification by a “denial of interiority [...] not interested in ‘spilling her guts’ in a confessional wallowing [nor] demanding R.E.S.P.E.C.T. from her bachelor suitors but subordination, supplication.”<sup><a href="#fn6-13725" id="fnr6-13725" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup> Siouxsie realizes, like her contemporary Grace Jones, that ironically she has all the power being an object rather than a subject, that idols “do not reproduce, but arise from the ashes, like the phoenix, or from the mirror, like the seductress.”<sup><a href="#fn7-13725" id="fnr7-13725" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup> In simple terms, this isn’t necessarily a feminist read of Gudas’ gothic ashen mirror table. Rather, Siouxsie and Grace Jones are proof of Goth’s ability to subsume a culture’s negativity and use it to its collective advantage as a means of bewitchment. Gudas wants us to stare at ourselves until we realize we all are being objectified and that we have the power to reclaim that negativity. </p>

    <p>But how? As we return from the otherworldly center of the tabletop and cross over the bevel threshold and back into reality, our floating head is reattached to our physical world self. And with the reflection of the room’s ceiling in every angle that you look into the tabletop, there is constant evidence that you haven’t left this realm of reality and thus any eeriness the table may of had dissipates to reveal that reality is haunting you like the invisible omnipresent god of the Shakers rather than you haunting it like Siouxsie’s bewitchment. So, like all of Goth culture—from its impractical fashion to its music’s lyrics—this table and its suggested seance are hyperbolic. In the context of a white cube gallery, wallpapered home, cubicle office, or virtually anywhere else, this table isn’t an <em>unheimliche</em> trojan horse for destroying the <em>homely</em> or subverting pop culture’s desire exhibition. Rather, as a perfect accumulation of Gothic tropes and modernism-before-modernism design, Gudas’ table fits right in with all that we deem safe and sterile and consequently never to be touched or examined again. The dust drowned in the resin, for example, doesn’t remind us that it belongs “to the outside, the exterior, the street, [or that dust] constantly creeps into the sacred arena of private spaces as a reminder that there is no impermeable boundaries between life and death.” It doesn’t cling to our fingertips like the mark from “a messenger of death, [a] signature of lost time.”<sup><a href="#fn8-13725" id="fnr8-13725" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup> And although our reflection <em>may</em> make us aware of our objectification, it doesn’t direct us toward “the capacity to [annihilate],” a mode in which pop culture becomes caustic to the status quo by “producing new potentials through the negation of what already exists.”<sup><a href="#fn9-13725" id="fnr9-13725" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Finally, the lack of modification or reimagining of the one-to-one replica of mundane modernist design weakens any argument for a forward-thinking aesthetic or discourse through the appropriation of the Shakers’ “ecstatic behavior during worship services.” This is all to say that like the naive teenage suburban goth performing a seance in their furnished basement and mispronouncing the foreign words in Aleister Crowley’s “magick” texts, this table leads us to believe that we’ve found the truth...on the surface. </p>

      <div class="name">Chris Pinter (Review)</div>
      <div class="year">December 2018</div>
    </div>

    <div class="content">

      <p>’Tis the holiday season in which nostalgia is all that speaks to us. The warmth of our “homes” during the month of December isn’t from the furnace of a three-bedroom suburban home or the fire burning in a rusty oil drum on the streets—it stems from our memories and the memories of other families’ that we weirdly seem to relate to even though we only hear their stories in passing. Chris Pinter’s painting <em>captures</em> this warm nostalgia, with the Charlie Brown Christmas tree, Paul Rand or Henri Matisse cutouts, and 1960s color palette. Slap some calligraphy on top of this composition and many of our mothers would be buying this up as a Christmas card on sale at their local Hallmark store.</p>

      <p>But Pinter’s painting isn’t <em>commenting</em> on this nostalgia—if anything, it seems to be frozen within it. Taken into context of the entire painting, the decorated Charlie Brown tree sits on a windowsill looking out on a barren winter landscape. You can see the reflection of the room’s interior in the imitation of window glass, abstractly represented by the white dots and strips that litter the lower half of the painting and the smudge of white paint in the center of the canvas. Are we supposed to murmur to ourselves, safe up in our bourgeoisie tower, “Oh, what a beautiful sight of the status quo. It’s so angelic without the filth and feral vagrants from the Southside of town, just like the good ol’ days”? Put another way, Pinter’s painting has all the makings of an Edward Hopper painting, but not the incentive to meditate on the idea of (or on a personal level, one’s feelings of) isolationism and solitude that stem from the modernity that Hopper depicted. Hopper succeeded by capturing the feeling of distance: if I take four steps forward I could introduce myself to the woman alone at the café table in <em>Automat</em>; or I’m a stone’s throw away from blasting the windows of <em>House by The Railroad</em>; or I’m close enough to the sunlit white wall of <em>Rooms by the Sea</em> that its blinding glare forces me to squint. Hopper’s work encapsulates the phrase “distance makes the heart grow fonder” and the potential that is elicited from the daydreams of closing such distances. Pinter’s painting, however, borders on a kitsch home decor sign hanging on the wallpapered wall of a suburban mom’s home, stating some sappy quote like “Home is where the heart is”—a familiarity that helps that mother be at peace with the outside world that is struggling to progress; a world she rarely takes a step into. Because such familiarity—an invulnerable safe-harbor-for-the-holidays feeling—only kindles nostalgic dependence in which the heart, and its sympathy, becomes scorched earth.</p>

    <div class="content">
      
      <p>Despite being a terribly sad song about Ian Curtis’ problems in his marriage, as well as his general frame of mind in the time leading up to his suicide in May 1980, Joy Division’s <em>Love Will Tear Us Apart</em> is considered a pop song that has been danced to, laughed at, cried to, and everything in between by generations of people regardless of how “hip” they are. For some reason, the despair of this song and other Joy Division songs doesn’t deter people from (ironically) celebrating life. Yet most people see goth culture and music as nothing but wallowing in self-pity—but that’s a misconception. Just because reveling in dismay is not the norm in society does not mean that goths are ultimately sad—rather, they are fascinated by the feelings and actions that that reveling can bring about. So, when mainstream audiences throw <em>Love Will Tear Us Apart</em> on at dance parties it’s not because they want to revisit a moment of loss; rather they wish to contemplate—in a subconscious, celebratory way—some potential in how they can construct their lives. </p>

      <p>Some of the most miserable people in this world are graphic designers. Regardless of one’s experience level within the profession of graphic design, most hear or know of more horror stories than success stories. Some of them are so desperately in love with graphic design that they will go to outrageous lengths—such as going into massive amounts of debt to attend an MFA program—to remedy their relationship with it. But maybe that’s why the horror stories keep happening with generation after generation of new graphic designers: they keep running away from the profession’s misery towards some better pursuit or a flash of hope rather than wallowing in the despair. </p>

      <p>Based on the lyrics found in the first verse of <em>Love Will Tear Us Apart</em>, one might think Curtis was secretly a graphic designer:</p>

      <blockquote>
      When the routine bites hard<br/>
      And ambitions are low<br/>
      And the resentment rides high<br/>
      But emotions wont grow<br/>
      And we’re changing our ways,<br/>
      Taking different roads<br/>
      Then love, love will tear us apart again
      </blockquote>
          
      <p>In the song <em>Disorder</em>, Curtis seems to remind designers of the desire to flee from client meetings:</p>

      <blockquote>
      It’s getting faster, moving faster now, it’s getting out of hand,<br/>
      On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, it’s a no man’s land,<br/>
      Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now,<br/>
      […] I’ve got the spirit, but lose the feeling.
      </blockquote>

      <p>For how often designers appropriate the waveforms from the cover of <em>Unknown Pleasures</em> for trivial urban wear and meme-esque ephemera, they certainly have trouble interpreting Curtis’ words or writhing to Joy Division’s melancholic rhythms to build some sort of self-actualization that goth culture stimulates. The band Bauhaus—who should be an easy entry point into goth culture for designers based on their name alone—mixed a myriad of genres outside the confines of punk to create their sound, similarly to the interdisciplinary definition that graphic designers love to advocate for yet never seem to actually realize. So where does this design culture that promotes arrogant behavior and fear of the eccentric come from? It comes from decades-old modernist principles and ethos that, unlike goth culture, are about shoveling self-doubt and anti-intellectualism on its practitioners, clients, and audiences, furthering the voyage on the downward spiral of hopelessness. Designers are taught in their undergraduate studies or graphic design coffee table books that the discipline revolves around a client, and that client will usually suck, but regardless of whether or not the client sucks designers need to translate the client’s message as they see fit while assuming the client’s audience lacks any intelligence to understand any level of wit or sophistication. Designers’ and clients’ lack of faith in people is without a doubt more disturbing than any mascara smeared goth. However, with this bullshit weighing on designers’ minds, graphic design does not need to be rebuilt from the ground up (although it’s education curriculum certainly does): with a designers’ day-to-day tasks shrouded in misery, all they need to do is start generating some sort of authenticity from this gloom like goths eagerly do.</p>

      <p>A movement towards authenticity as a designer comes from visually interpreting our personal interests and neurotic human tendencies. It’s an attempt at democratizing graphic design not in how it is made (i.e., platforms such as Squarespace) but in how it’s approached and consumed by a public. And this sort of inclusiveness doesn’t come from a “genius” designer’s ethos or modernist principles that state what is the correct way to design the built world around us. Photographer Diane Arbus once said, “The more specific you are, the more general it'll be,” meaning the inclusivity that modernism says its striving for doesn’t come from creating comprehensive constructs from the outset, rather, as Arbus states, it’s engendered by presenting or formulating our modesty and arcane interests and seeing if anyone responds to or inquires about them. From there we can find the esoteric collectives we all seem to be looking for. Therefore, even if a work doesn’t strike a nerve within any viewer, the act of introducing such eccentric—and in some instances, embarrassing—subjects is a small step toward conveying design that can be trusted, comforting, and participatory when trying to initiate a discourse for and sustained by publics or laypeople, not those in the position to be exploitative.</p>

      <p>Graphic designers need not to be afraid of traversing the gothic darkness and eventually through it. Coming out the other side wearing black trench coats, lipstick for eyeshadow, and teased out hair is a statement of who we truly are and that we’re not afraid to show that side of ourselves regardless of what modernism hauntingly tells us to feel or believe to be ideal. But don’t be mistaken by this bold statement: Goth culture is not look-at-me culture. If anything, many passersby are repulsed or confused by goth style, yet they are always asking, “Why do they dress/act like that?” As graphic designers, we can harness this inquiry by stylizing atomized esoteric communities and built environments as human complexities, thus establishing a tolerance and approach towards each other that is visceral, intriguing, and, most importantly, healthy.</p>

    <div class="content">

      <p>Being a great designer has nothing to do with your ability to identify typefaces, or color theory, or how you construct and use a grid system. Instead, great designers are informed and engaged citizens—individuals who understand the history of our society and world, the consequences of those histories, and have opinions that influence their actions of the present day. They build practices in which their citizenship informs their practice and vice versa. But for a majority of us, graphic design history is taught as a slideshow of images, addressing only period styles and the names of famous designers. Educator and philosopher Paulo Freire called this form of pedagogy the “banking model” of education—a metaphor for students as containers into which educators place knowledge.<sup><a href="#Historyfn:1" id="Historyfnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Freire argued that this model reinforces a lack of critical thinking and knowledge ownership in students, which in turn reinforces oppression. Students and designers get nothing from this “banking model” of education other than a fetish for nostalgia and commodification. </p>

      <p>The publisher Standards Manual is guilty of exploiting this fetishization by reprinting and overpricing vintage brand guideline books that were never meant to be sold in the first place. What are people (designers or laypeople) of the contemporary world supposed to gain from viewing these commodified artifacts? A better understanding of how these manuals use outdated practices? An understanding that corporations and clients rule our sensibilities when it comes to play within our design process? Standards Manual are certainly not approaching the production or the purpose of these “artifacts” in such a critical manner.<sup><a href="#Historyfn:2" id="Historyfnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Instead, they are capitalizing on graphic design’s love for nostalgia and superficiality, a product of how we teach and view the profession and discipline’s history. Standards Manual’s reprint of the 1977 Environmental Protection Agency Graphic Standards System manual, in particular, irks me. To capitalize on the EPA name, and consequently stimulating a conversation about vintage aesthetics, especially at a time when the Trump Administration and the EPA’s director Scott Pruitt are dismantling laws and regulations in order to line their and lobbyists’ pockets with more money, is despicable.</p>

      <p>Graphic design history is also seen as vital form of highlighting the fundamentals of the discipline. For example, the work of the Bauhaus or Massimo Vignelli have been vital to the formation of design and should definitely be viewed for novelty’s sake, but graphic design is now a discipline—it’s no longer trying to find its foundation as it was in the past. What graphic design needs to be doing now is evolving its foundation, staying current with the world and its people. Putting a focus on the memorization of outdated Bauhaus principles or branding guidelines of 40 years past doesn’t improve the culture or aesthetics we construct today. We’re living in the hastily evolving 21st century in which the exchange of knowledge has been easily disseminated by the internet. The fundamentals of graphic design can easily be obtained by anyone who has an interest and a passion to do so. Knowledge of the Bauhaus or Massimo Vignelli’s work isn’t mindless baggage, but their practices and works addressed the issues of their time, not ours.</p>

      <p>Additionally, Paul Rand’s work—maybe the most prevalent name during the most idolized period of design—has formulated contemporary graphic design as a conservative and commodified construct: no play, no opinions, no dissent—only a pursuit of perfection, clarity, and certainty, all aspects that no one would ever use to describe the world we lived in then or now. Perfection is in the opinion of the viewer, clarity doesn’t always mean strictness or minimalism, and certainty should never be a goal (an urge to inquire, on the other hand, should). I struggle to see many designers questioning the thinking and ordering of the world and instead I see them trying to fit into the profession of graphic design, consequently creating a homogenous world after they willing abandon the idiosyncratic sensibilities and traits of their practices. For a man who had a tantrum when a woman, Sheila Levrant de Bretteville, was hired to replace him as the director of graduate studies at Yale University after he retired, I’m not sure Paul Rand and his elitist work and ethos are what designers should be obsessing over or aspiring to be. In addition, there is a severe lack of female and international designers, works, and voices in the graphic design historical canon. Tadanori Yokoo’s visceral work, Maureen Mooren’s acutely conceptual work, and Bretteville’s humanitarian-centric design work and open-minded education curriculum have done more to make our society feel inclusive, diverse, and thought-provoking than Rand and other white men of the celebrated graphic design canon—their contributions of corporate branding and dogmatic modernist principles only perpetuate our capitalist, yes-men society.</p>

      <p>Moreover, modernist principles regard a design not as a proposal but as a prescription,<sup><a href="#Historyfn:3" id="Historyfnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup> and those writings of the past were made to direct and shape a profession and discipline still trying to find its footing. Michael Rock’s 1996 essay <em>Designer As Author</em>, for example, was written to question a time in which technological advances with desktop publishing deconstructed the distinct roles of a graphic designer, typesetter, type designer, et cetera, and allowed authorship with those new design tools to be an avenue for anyone. So why is it still gospel for contemporary designers? It’s bullshit to talk about “designer as author” or “designer as whatever” idioms within the context of the present day because they state the obvious—as a graphic designer you should be editing, curating, instilling a point a view and so much more. More importantly, does it not concern designers that there is a severe lack of contemporary and substantial graphic design theory—writing and dialogs that go beyond <em>Fast Company</em> articles about how Google kerned its logo or <em>AIGA Eye On Design</em> designer showcase blog entries? Rereading 1990s design criticism can be fun or inspiring to look back on, but the legibility wars and modernism versus postmodernism debates are no longer a part of our present day profession. We can’t expect Andrew Blauvelt, Lorraine Wild, Jeffery Keedy and the rest of the <em>Emigre</em> squad to be the only voices willing to write or discuss design criticism. </p>

      <p>Designers strive to make timeless work, but the output is usually viewed through the lens of style and therefore is a product of its time and place of conception. What is timeless are the histories of business, law, politics, ecology, environmental science, and many others because they are built on theories and tested formulas. Not being exclusive in their understanding of the functionality of the world, these fields have realized that design is the “central metaphor of our time” and have begun to teach design within the curriculums of business schools, law schools, and so many other schools of thought.<sup><a href="#Historyfn:4" id="Historyfnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup> So why doesn’t graphic design reciprocate those feelings? Having a critical understanding and opinions about these fields—who also happen to be clients for many designers—would help inform how graphic design fits within a myriad of cultural contexts while also strengthening and amplifying the relationships between designers, clients, and audiences. Furthermore, if design education were to teach the history of fields other than graphic design, using practices established by Freire that treat students as “co-creators of knowledge” (a truer version of “designer as authors”), it would inspire designers to leave their bubbles of exclusivity and engage in conversation and activism with publics they share the world with. </p>

      <p>At this point it should be noted that I’m not advocating for graphic design’s history to be completely abandoned and forgotten. History in general should never be ignored—as the old adage goes, those who do not learn history are doomed to repeat it. To simply abandon graphic design’s history would be ignorant of the fact that improving the present world needs to happen in parallel with an understanding of its history. But there is a difference between referencing history and perpetuating history. A great example of this parallel model can be seen in the work Hagen Verleger did at the Van Eyke Academy. After realizing that the labs and workplaces of the academy were named after men, Verleger created way-finding signage that would be situated adjacent to the current signage except it would use female names. Verleger also rearranged the academy’s library so that all books with male authors or editors had their spines facing inward on the shelves. This revealed a lack of books written or edited by women within the academy’s library. Verleger’s signage is now a permeant fixture throughout the campus and the academy’s library has now devoted its efforts to diversify it’s catalog. If Verleger painted over the pervious signage or removed the male-centric books from the library shelves, the argument would have been diminished because there would have been nothing there to inform viewers of how the past has constructed our present and future. It also worth noting that Verleger is a young designer who is better situated to address contemporary issues than an old-guard designer looking for publicity and quick cash to keep themselves relevant. </p>

      <p>(As an aside, old-guard graphic designers have every right to run their practices as they see fit, but there is also responsibility that comes with their celebrity status. To revisit Michael Rock’s “central metaphor” quote, graphic design has seeped beyond its borders. What bothers me is that the old-guard isn’t seizing this opportunity in which the public sphere sees the significance of graphic design and are taking an interest in the field. Instead the old guard, our supposed leaders, fall to the pressure of commerce and milk the defining visual traits that gave them, as individuals, celebrity status.)</p>

      <p>The argument to study design history through a political and sociological lens in parallel to the present day has always been alive, its just rarely acted upon, especially by celebrity designers with the loudest voices. Designers need to include more history into their daily practices, but to me that doesn’t mean referencing or imitating major case studies or period styles of the past. Instead of a memorized homogenous design history, our personal memories can be frequented source material. When constructed within a vernacular context, our memories reveal our honest and personal strengths and weaknesses. These memories, most likely, will also be certain shared experiences, and by giving form to these truths graphic design output can be much more relatable for a wider audience. The aforementioned lack of diversity (e.g. people of color and women) problem within the graphic design canon, I believe, stems from the white privilege, systematic racism, and sexism that construct the United States’ past, present, and future. An honesty-driven approach within our practices is a simple and direct solution to instilling empathy within the discipline. It’s similar to a 2016 study, reported by German Lopez of <em>Vox</em>: </p>

      <blockquote>
      Researchers stumbled on a radical tactic for reducing another person’s bigotry: a frank, brief conversation. The study, authored by David Broockman at Stanford University and Joshua Kalla at the University of California Berkeley, looked at how simple conversations can help combat anti-transgender attitudes. In the research, people canvassed the homes of more than 500 voters in South Florida. The canvassers, who could be trans or not, asked the voters to simply put themselves in the shoes of trans people—to understand their problems—through a 10-minute, nonconfrontational conversation. The hope was that the brief discussion could lead people to reevaluate their biases. It worked. The trial found not only that voters’ anti-trans attitudes declined but that they remained lower three months later, showing an enduring result. And those voters’ support for laws that protect trans people from discrimination increased, even when they were presented with counterarguments for such laws.<sup><a href="#Historyfn:5" id="Historyfnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Canvassing is an uncomfortable act for both the canvasser and the public being canvassed, but there is a great deal of potential to learn and gain empathy within the construct of discomfort. That said, I can’t think of a better way to sustain discomfort with designers’ practices than to include the public within graphic design discourse and forums. As design history professor Michael J. Golec has proposed:</p>

      I have very often heard graphic designers remark that the role of the graphic designer is to “educate” the client on the value of graphic design. Wouldn’t it be an ideal situation if clients came to graphic designers already familiar with the cultural, social, and political relevance of graphic design, because of having attended courses on the history of graphic design? One step towards accomplishing this ideal would be to adopt a more inclusive attitude towards what constitutes an audience for the history of graphic design.<sup><a href="#Historyfn:6" id="Historyfnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup>

      <p>Too often design is dismissive of its audiences. It has lead to work that audiences don’t trust<sup><a href="#Historyfn:7" id="Historyfnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">7</a></sup> or don’t feel a connection to<sup><a href="#Historyfn:8" id="Historyfnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">8</a></sup>, yet graphic designers trivially obsess over critiquing said work. I believe including the public as a voice in our discourse would lead to a profession that is less contemptuous for designers, clients, and audiences. I’m not saying that clients and audiences should boss designers around, but letting them direct conversations—about <em>their</em> needs (rather than us tell them what <em>their</em> needs are) or proposals for inclusivity, for starters—would allow designers to truly construct culture and aesthetics that are progressive and for their audiences, rather than eye candy that feeds graphic designers’ self-preservation mentality. Clients and lay-people want sophisticated and intellectual work, and to treat them like philistines obstructs that pursuit. The blame as to why clients pick boring concepts or lay-people don’t grasp a concept falls on designers and how we treat them and what we feed them, which is usually an offshoot of the banality we feed ourselves. When our practices aren’t sophisticated or intellectual and our solutions are nothing but a layer of sheen on a problem, what else are clients to expect from graphic design?</p>

      <p>Lastly, much of what we place within the graphic design canon seems to be classified as “perfect” or “handsome,” terms that are completely subjective, and designers striving for these labels lead the profession to the pursuit of toxic, elitist banality. So I’m curious if another form of design artifacts can enter the canon of graphic design history and if the study of said artifacts would benefit the field, instill a sense of urgency to study graphic design history through the aforementioned critical lens or give a platform to more progressive voices. As D.I.Y. tools such as Squarespace or affordable Photoshop-esque apps become everyday tools for the public, I propose that we begin to study the vernacular graphic design output and artifacts made by the public. Although clients provide designers project briefs, designers <em>should</em> and need to be designing for audiences not their clients. Therefore would we better understand our audiences and publics if we understood why they make what they make with D.I.Y. tools? </p>

      <p>By studying vernacular design I believe that we may be confronted with the fact that laypeople are more creative than we give them credit for when their true vernacular—rather than their attempt to copy—is revealed through the ephemera and branding they create on their own. During my time at Cranbrook Academy of Art, on the outskirts of Detroit, Michigan, I love to see vernacular logos for diners, automotive garages, credit unions, and so many other utilitarian establishments. While it could be argued that this is my personal taste, many of these artifacts inform my design practice: the choice of typefaces, the way that those typefaces may or may not be manipulated, the juxtaposition of imagery and typography, et cetera. Regardless of whether it is “good” or “bad,” these works instill feelings within me: happiness, humor, inspiration, disgust, and everything in-between. Why shouldn’t design be as expressive and visceral as the fine arts? Design that strives to be invisible, or is afraid to be an art form, or is afraid to show a slight hint of sincerity and naivety, advocates for oppression upon it’s audiences and itself as a profession. Artist/designer John Heartfield’s anti-nazi/fascism photomontages have done more to inspire collectivity and emotion than Rand’s iconic IBM branding. See Red Women’s Workshop posters may be vernacular, and their practitioners non-designers, but their practice established an alternative definition for publishing: a social process “where issues and ideas can be articulated and acted upon, where skills are exchanged and knowledge co-produced.”<sup><a href="#Historyfn:9" id="Historyfnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">9</a></sup> To quote Peter Hall’s <em>The Uses of Failure</em> lecture:</p>

      <blockquote>
      We don’t need to justify design’s importance to the world or to the art establishment. We need to look into how design works and where it is going wrong. We need a new generation not to venerate design but to sniff out failure.<sup><a href="#Historyfn:10" id="Historyfnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">10</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>Graphic design history is fine for reminiscing, but to study it in such a manner has lead the profession to commodify and worship banality rather than instill an urgency to inquire about progressivism. “The core of [the] profession is analysis: a critical eye.” Quoting Max Bruinsma, “Every design, in essence, is a criticism of the context for which it has been produced. A good design ‘activates’ those contexts by offering an understanding of, a comment on, or an alternative to, them.”<sup><a href="#Historyfn:11" id="Historyfnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">11</a></sup> When navel gazing defines the discipline, its output, and its history, it’s proof that the profession has abandoned its morals and principles to constructing a more just and inclusive world. </p>
