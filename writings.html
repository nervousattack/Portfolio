      <p class="titles"><em>Nothingness Aesthetic</em> &rarr; 2018</p>
      <p>When I don’t know what to do formally with work I’m designing, I filter it through a black and white aesthetic that is clearly derivative of black metal vernacular. I’ve been doing this since I first discovered the methodology during my freshman year of college. But why? So much is lost through the process: whether it’s typography or photography, the details are rounded and flattened, creating gigantic blobs drained of color and gradations. Furthermore, it’s rarely appropriate in the staid world of marketing and branding, so at times it would seem that this process borders more on procrastination than productivity—something Brian Eno has commented on: </p>

      <blockquote>
      I’ve seen musicians stuck for an idea, and what they’ll do between takes is just diddle around, playing the blues or whatever, just to reassure themselves that, “Hey, I’m not useless. Look, I can do this.” But I believe that to have that [technique] to fall back on is an illusion. It’s better to say, “I’m useless,” and start from that position. I think the way technique gets in the way is by fooling you into thinking that you are doing something when you actually are not.
      </blockquote>

      <p>As I write this at the end of my first year of my MFA studies, I worry that the work I’ve done in this aesthetic has been nothing but Eno defined “illusions.” However, at the same time, there is this overbearing presence of uselessness running through my mind whenever I approach work. If this black and white methodology encapsulates such a dichotomy then there must be something deeper or fulfilling within it than a procrastinating habit. Playing with darkness must mean something.</p>

      <p>I interpret most things through the lens of music, particularly extreme music: aforementioned black metal, hardcore punk, and even ambient drone (“extreme” for those listeners that don’t have the patience). I’ve had discussions with people who don’t understand how I can listen or stomach such doom and gloom noise, yet all I can ever tell them is that the screaming, repetition, sloppy craftsmanship, and toilet bowl production are all somehow calming. However, calmness does not equal pleasure in this instance. Uncertainty haunts my everything, and I believe most would agree with that sentiment. But extreme music creates <em>something</em> with the nothingness of uncertainty, constantly pursing the capture of nothingness’ form, weight, and sound while still letting it continue to be nothingness. In other words, as philosopher Eugene Thacker writes, </p>

      <blockquote>
      the sound of the abyss is not silence, or quiet, or noise, but <em>unsound</em>. That which is unsound—like a building, or a mind—is always unstable, continually about to collapse. […] An unsound is akin, perhaps, to the term ‘unknowing’ […] an undoing or unraveling, denoting both the negation of the ground of knowledge, as well as the paradoxical apprehension of an absolute limit.<sup><a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">1</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>I guess what I’m getting at is this negation and darkness is imagination itself. In a world in which “modernity [has caused every] human creation to cover up the anguish of nothingness, bearing its burden with a simulated faith in reason,”<sup><a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">2</a></sup> digging the abyss of nothingness a little deeper—whether it’s through extreme music or a rotten black and white visual aesthetic—is to do our greater good for humanity, keeping imagination alive and well. And to know that others are out there somewhere nearby in the pitch black darkness—digging and scraping to increase the abyss’ depth so that the lights of our ever-advancing surveillance-driven world don’t burn away its mysteries—pressingly evokes camaraderie instead of loneliness within us. Put another way, Jean Baudrillard warned that the loss of night and its darkness brings about a bland homogenization of humanity and its history: </p>

      <blockquote>
      like the situation of the man who has lost his shadow: either he has become transparent, and the light passes right though him or, alternatively, he is lit from all angles, overexposed and defenseless against all sources of technology, images and information, without any way of refracting their rays.<sup><a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">3</a></sup>
      </blockquote>

      <p>If darkness keeps our individuality intact, then my aforementioned sense of calmness instilled by extreme music is because extreme music doesn’t impose itself on one’s space and instead creates a landscape of darkness one could belong to.<sup><a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Therefore, the overwhelming decay brought upon by my black and white methodology allows for reassessing what moments within the new disfigurement evoke a desire to renew endeavors that once seemed lost for both myself and, more importantly, my audience—or as Gilles Deleuze states, it’s “a process of folding, unfolding and refolding” that liberates “the subject from the melancholy of the unrepresentable.”<sup><a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">5</a></sup> In addition, this methodology gives me something to believe in and therefore something to resist. Black metal bands and enthusiasts believe in Satan because as atheists they would have nothing to invigorate their imaginations of destroying God and his creations. Philosopher Nick Land elaborates on this idea by stating, “Anyone who does not exult at the thought of driving nails through the limbs of the Nazarene is something less than an atheist; merely a disappointed slave.”<sup><a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">6</a></sup> It would seem then that this nothingness methodology and aesthetic I’ve constantly returned to is not an Eno “illusion” but rather the subconscious means to make our world a little bit darker so that none of us end up as unimaginative slaves to capitalism, graphic design, or whatever else may shine a sterile brightness on our built environment.</p>

      <p class="titles"><em>All We Every Wanted</em> &rarr; 2018</p>
    	<p>Despite being a terribly sad song about Ian Curtis’ problems in his marriage, as well as his general frame of mind in the time leading up to his suicide in May 1980, Joy Division’s <em>Love Will Tear Us Apart</em> is considered a pop song that has been danced to, laughed at, cried to and everything in between by generations of people regardless of how “hip” they are. For some reason, the despair of this song and other Joy Division songs doesn’t deter people from (ironically) celebrating life. Yet most people see goth culture and music as nothing but wallowing in self-pity—but that’s a misconception. Just because reveling in dismay is not the norm in society does not mean that goths are ultimately sad—rather, they are fascinated by the feelings and actions that that reveling can bring about. So, when mainstream audiences throw <em>Love Will Tear Us Apart</em> on at dance parties it’s not because they want to revisit a moment of loss but rather contemplate—in a subconscious, celebratory way—some potential in how they can construct their lives. </p>

			<p>Some of the most miserable people in this world are graphic designers. Regardless of one’s experience level within the profession of graphic design, most hear or know of more horror stories than success stories. Some of them are so desperately in love with graphic design that they will go to outrageous lengths—such as going into massive amounts of debt to attend an MFA program—to remedy their relationship with it. But maybe that’s why the horror stories keep happening with generation after generation of new graphic designers: they keep running away from the profession’s misery towards some better pursuit or a flash of hope rather than wallowing in the despair. </p>

			<p>Based on the lyrics found in the first verse of <em>Love Will Tear Us Apart</em>, one might think Curtis was secretly a graphic designer:</p>

			<blockquote>
			When the routine bites hard<br/>
			And ambitions are low<br/>
			And the resentment rides high<br/>
			But emotions wont grow<br/>
			And we’re changing our ways,<br/>
			Taking different roads<br/>
			Then love, love will tear us apart again
			</blockquote>
          
			<p>In the song <em>Disorder</em>, Curtis seems to remind designers of the desire to flee from client meetings:</p>

			<blockquote>
			It’s getting faster, moving faster now, it’s getting out of hand,<br/>
			On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, it’s a no man’s land,<br/>
			Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now,<br/>
			[…] I’ve got the spirit, but lose the feeling.
			</blockquote>

			<p>For how often designers appropriate the waveforms from the cover of <em>Unknown Pleasures</em> for trivial urban wear and meme-esque ephemera, they certainly have trouble interpreting Curtis’ words or writhing to Joy Division’s melancholic rhythms to build some sort of self-actualization that goth culture stimulates. The band Bauhaus—who should be an easy entry point into goth culture for designers based on their name alone—mixed a myriad of genres outside the confines of punk to create their sound, similarly to the interdisciplinary definition that graphic designers love to advocate for yet never seem to actually realize. So where does this design culture that promotes arrogant behavior and fear of the eccentric come from? It comes from decades-old modernist principles and ethos that, unlike goth culture, are about shoveling self-doubt and anti-intellectualism on its practitioners, clients, and audiences, furthering the voyage on the downward spiral of hopelessness. Designers are taught in their undergraduate studies or graphic design coffee table books that graphic design revolves around a client, and that client will usually suck, but regardless of whether or not the client sucks, designers need to translate the client’s message as they see fit while assuming the client’s audience lacks any intelligence to understand any level of wit or sophistication. Designers and clients lack of faith in people is without a doubt more disturbing than any mascara smeared goth. However, with this bullshit weighing on designers’ minds, graphic design does not need to be rebuilt from the ground up (although it’s education curriculum certainly does): with a designers’ miserable day-to-day tasks shrouded in darkness, all they need to do is start generating some sort of authenticity from this gloom like goths eagerly do.</p>

    	<p>For me, my first step towards authenticity as a designer has come from visually interpreting—with song lyrics from bands I listened to during my teenage years, to video game interfaces, to a decade old poem I wrote about traveling on buses—my neuroticism and self-doubt on the surface of posters for all to see. In some way or another, this poster series was about trying to democratize graphic design not in how it is made (i.e., platforms such as Squarespace) but in how it’s approached and consumed by a public. But this sort of inclusiveness I’m striving towards doesn’t come from a “genius” designer’s ethos or modernist principles that state what is the correct way to design the built world around us. Photographer Diane Arbus once said, “The more specific you are, the more general it’ll be.” To me, the inclusivity that modernism says its striving for doesn’t come from creating comprehensive constructs from the outset, rather, as Arbus states, it’s engendered by presenting or formulating our obscure interests or modesty and seeing if anyone responds to or inquires about them. From there we can find the esoteric collectives we all seem to be looking for. Therefore, even if the poster series I created doesn’t strike a nerve within any viewer, the act of introducing such eccentric—and in some instances, embarrassing—subjects that I’m interested in or dealing with is a small step toward conveying design that can be trusted and comforting when trying to initiate a discourse for and sustained by publics or laypeople, not those in the position to be exploitative.</p>

			<p>Graphic designers need not to be afraid to traverse the gothic darkness and eventually through it. Coming out the other side wearing black trench coats, lipstick for eyeshadow, and teased out hair is a statement of who we truly are and that we’re not afraid to show that side of ourselves regardless of what modernism hauntingly tells us to feel or believe to be ideal. But don’t be mistaken by this bold statement: Goth culture is not look-at-me culture. If anything, many passersby are repulsed or confused by goth style, thus weeding out people and audiences that goths don’t need to concern themselves with and can instead focus on indulging in their immediate relationships. As graphic designers, this is the type of built environment we need to be making for others. By “styling” atomized esoteric communities as welcoming, our tolerance and approach towards each other can be visceral, intriguing, and, most importantly, healthy. </p>

      <p class="titles"><em>Swati Piparsania</em> &rarr; 2018</p>
      <p>From their book <em>are we human?</em>, Beatriz Colomina and Mark Wigley define design as</p>

      <blockquote>
      defense. Most theories of design present the human as under some kind of threat that needs to be urgently countered by design. The defense is seen to draw from some quality deeply embedded in the human, as if design itself is the natural human way to preserve the human. The most radical attempts to reshape the human are typically carried out under this guise of reinforcing and protecting the human. Design is a paradoxical gesture that changes the human in order to protect it.
      </blockquote>

      <p>This definition, although never stated in such a critical manner, is most often considered “good design” within the disciplines of design because it’s never challenged to be any other way. But Swati Piparsania’s work does the opposite of Colomina and Wigley’s definition and that’s why her work is so vital. Rather than protect humans, her designed objects expose humans for who they are, and this vulnerability leads to a discourse in which users—rather than designers—lead the discussion about what is needed, what is wrong, and what is useful in our lives. In a way, Piparsania’s objects make room for each of to be wrong, giving us opportunities to reflect on how we each participate in our world’s built environments.</p>

      <p>While Piparsania’s work may lack conclusive or detailed scientific research, her work is still rooted very much in reality because it is based on what we all survey in this world and either have become oblivious to or believe we don’t possess the means to make a change. Yet her objects are also fictional because, like any great work of fiction, they spark the imagination within a user to reframe or rethink what could be done with something so inconceivably wrong. Furthermore, unlike most designed products that are marketed as necessities, Piparsania’s objects are participatory, letting you decided how you want to behave rather than modernist and Silicon Valley ethos and systems telling you how to feel or do something.</p>

      <p>Author Ursula Le Guin, known for her fictional writings, once remarked that “all of us have to learn how to invent our lives, make them up, imagine them. We need to be taught these skills; we need guides to show us how. If we don’t, our lives get made up for us by other people.” Piparsania’s <em>Gridded Walking</em> object is one such guide for us to fulfill our lives, as Le Guin states, in a constant inventive and imaginative way. The object allows up to four standing users to bear their weight against four quadrants of the object to create a mobile conversation pit (the potted plant as a centerpiece also helps to brighten the mood)—nothing needs to be held, and only the conversation of the four users can guide the entrapped group in a new direction. But it’s not until you’ve used <em>Gridded Walking</em> that you realize how it reverses our natural modern inclination to lean back and walk away from a conversation into a form of comfort, letting our egos slide off our relaxed shoulders as we giggle and embrace how we communicate to one another. It’s like a potato sack race, but with eight legs bound together and no end-goal in sight.</p>

      <p>Piparsania’s <em>Take Your Plant For A Walk</em> object series takes <em>Gridded Walking</em>’s awkward moments and applies them solely to individual use cases. By taking your houseplant for a walk outside, like we would with a pet dog or even a toddler, we further let our egos and facades drop and, in a way, become confident fools. But foolishness should not be confused with ignorance because the absurdity and humor of this object and activity allow us to be open and vulnerable, leading to design conversations that aren’t about the need to protect or isolate ourselves <em>from</em> each other, but rather that we need to protect each other with unprejudiced compassion.</p>

      <p><em>Ramps</em>, Piparsania’s most recent work, bring these ideas of awareness, activity, and absurdity together once more. Low-level pastel pink wooden ramps liter the floors of a space and suggest that we walk upon them. They are a playground of sorts for adults—although just as much as for children—built upon an invitation of curiosity. Walking over, across, or even within these ramps, one comes to the conclusion, “Does haste really improve our lives?” As Ferris Bueller once said, “Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.” By fabricating inclined trails of the less traveled, filled with hinderances and obstructions, Piparsania is building both inspiration and resilience in how we approach the mundane, tragic, dire, and beautiful moments of our lives. </p>

      <p>Piparsania’s objects are not representations—<em>they are</em> exactly as we function in spaces and in society. They critique society by letting us behave exactly as we normally would. We are not actor’s wearing these objects; we are not guinea pigs using these objects: we are ourselves, no more and no less. Moreover, and most importantly, Piparsania’s objects are more than just objects—they are a commentary not necessarily on our lives but on design’s overbearing assumption that it knows best. They are reimaginings of how we can construct the built environment around us, with laypeople’s opinions and views holding equal value to designers in that conversation. </p>
