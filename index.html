With the gallery's architecture in mind, and 321's DIY approach to a sometimes white-collar profession, I mimicked the actual gallery space by spelling out 321 Gallery along the walls and corners of the gallery’s floorplan, with an image, show title, or website navigation taking the last corner. This lets the “logo” function both vertically and horizontally, with dissonant typography conditionally branding both the gallery and their artists as one entity, drawing out eccentricities that are confrontational and memorable to their audience.</p>

          <p><em>All We Every Wanted</em> essay &rarr; 2018</p>
          	<p>Despite being a terribly sad song about Ian Curtis’ problems in his marriage, as well as his general frame of mind in the time leading up to his suicide in May 1980, Joy Division’s <em>Love Will Tear Us Apart</em> is considered a pop song that has been danced to, laughed at, cried to and everything in between by generations of people regardless of how “hip” they are. For some reason, the despair of this song and other Joy Division songs doesn’t deter people from (ironically) celebrating life. Yet most people see goth culture and music as nothing but wallowing in self-pity—but that’s a misconception. Just because reveling in dismay is not the norm in society does not mean that goths are ultimately sad—rather, they are fascinated by the feelings and actions that that reveling can bring about. So, when mainstream audiences throw <em>Love Will Tear Us Apart</em> on at dance parties it’s not because they want to revisit a moment of loss but rather contemplate—in a subconscious, celebratory way—some potential in how they can construct their lives. </p>

			<p>Some of the most miserable people in this world are graphic designers. Regardless of one’s experience level within the profession of graphic design, most hear or know of more horror stories than success stories. Some of them are so desperately in love with graphic design that they will go to outrageous lengths—such as going into massive amounts of debt to attend an MFA program—to remedy their relationship with it. But maybe that’s why the horror stories keep happening with generation after generation of new graphic designers: they keep running away from the profession’s misery towards some better pursuit or a flash of hope rather than wallowing in the despair. </p>

			<p>Based on the lyrics found in the first verse of <em>Love Will Tear Us Apart</em>, one might think Curtis was secretly a graphic designer:</p>

			<blockquote>
			When the routine bites hard<br/>
			And ambitions are low<br/>
			And the resentment rides high<br/>
			But emotions wont grow<br/>
			And we’re changing our ways,<br/>
			Taking different roads<br/>
			Then love, love will tear us apart again
			</blockquote>
          </div>
          <div class="text">
			<p>In the song <em>Disorder</em>, Curtis seems to remind designers of the desire to flee from client meetings:</p>

			<blockquote>
			It’s getting faster, moving faster now, it’s getting out of hand,<br/>
			On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, it’s a no man’s land,<br/>
			Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now,<br/>
			[…] I’ve got the spirit, but lose the feeling.
			</blockquote>

			<p>For how often designers appropriate the waveforms from the cover of <em>Unknown Pleasures</em> for trivial urban wear and meme-esque ephemera, they certainly have trouble interpreting Curtis’ words or writhing to Joy Division’s melancholic rhythms to build some sort of self-actualization that goth culture stimulates. The band Bauhaus—who should be an easy entry point into goth culture for designers based on their name alone—mixed a myriad of genres outside the confines of punk to create their sound, similarly to the interdisciplinary definition that graphic designers love to advocate for yet never seem to actually realize. So where does this design culture that promotes arrogant behavior and fear of the eccentric come from? It comes from decades-old modernist principles and ethos that, unlike goth culture, are about shoveling self-doubt and anti-intellectualism on its practitioners, clients, and audiences, furthering the voyage on the downward spiral of hopelessness. Designers are taught in their undergraduate studies or graphic design coffee table books that graphic design revolves around a client, and that client will usually suck, but regardless of whether or not the client sucks, designers need to translate the client’s message as they see fit while assuming the client’s audience lacks any intelligence to understand any level of wit or sophistication. Designers and clients lack of faith in people is without a doubt more disturbing than any mascara smeared goth. However, with this bullshit weighing on designers’ minds, graphic design does not need to be rebuilt from the ground up (although it’s education curriculum certainly does): with a designers’ miserable day-to-day tasks shrouded in darkness, all they need to do is start generating some sort of authenticity from this gloom like goths eagerly do.</p>
		  </div>
          <div class="third">
          	<p>For me, my first step towards authenticity as a designer has come from visually interpreting—with song lyrics from bands I listened to during my teenage years, to video game interfaces, to a decade old poem I wrote about traveling on buses—my neuroticism and self-doubt on the surface of posters for all to see. In some way or another, this poster series was about trying to democratize graphic design not in how it is made (i.e., platforms such as Squarespace) but in how it’s approached and consumed by a public. But this sort of inclusiveness I’m striving towards doesn’t come from a “genius” designer’s ethos or modernist principles that state what is the correct way to design the built world around us. Photographer Diane Arbus once said, “The more specific you are, the more general it’ll be.” To me, the inclusivity that modernism says its striving for doesn’t come from creating comprehensive constructs from the outset, rather, as Arbus states, it’s engendered by presenting or formulating our obscure interests or modesty and seeing if anyone responds to or inquires about them. From there we can find the esoteric collectives we all seem to be looking for. Therefore, even if the poster series I created doesn’t strike a nerve within any viewer, the act of introducing such eccentric—and in some instances, embarrassing—subjects that I’m interested in or dealing with is a small step toward conveying design that can be trusted and comforting when trying to initiate a discourse for and sustained by publics or laypeople, not those in the position to be exploitative.</p>

			<p>Graphic designers need not to be afraid to traverse the gothic darkness and eventually through it. Coming out the other side wearing black trench coats, lipstick for eyeshadow, and teased out hair is a statement of who we truly are and that we’re not afraid to show that side of ourselves regardless of what modernism hauntingly tells us to feel or believe to be ideal. But don’t be mistaken by this bold statement: Goth culture is not look-at-me culture. If anything, many passersby are repulsed or confused by goth style, thus weeding out people and audiences that goths don’t need to concern themselves with and can instead focus on indulging in their immediate relationships. As graphic designers, this is the type of built environment we need to be making for others. By “styling” atomized esoteric communities as welcoming, our tolerance and approach towards each other can be visceral, intriguing, and, most importantly, healthy. </p></div>

          <p><span class="titles">The Fund For Pratt (proposal) &rarr; 2017</span><span class="spacer"></span>Built upon the idea of disseminating Pratt Institute’s curriculum, the new Fund for Pratt campaign turns the fundraising department of Pratt Institute into a producer and publisher while stripping alienating money-talk from its messaging. Periodical direct mail spotlights the work, theories, or criticisms by Pratt alumni, faculty, and students. Essays, manifestos, instructional art, concrete poetry, and much more subvert the expectations of what direct mail can be. The email campaign profiles those same alumni, faculty, and students’ processes and practices. All of these works are then collected on an archival website to be shared with an external Pratt Institute audience. The branding is a simple nomenclature system, allowing the collateral to be a blank canvas for the featured artist/designer/author, while also framing the collateral as documents&mdash;or evidence&mdash;of a Pratt education and the good it is doing in the world, not exclusively on the Pratt campus.</p><p><sup>Designed at Pratt Institute</sup></p>

In some cases, disparate and opulent after-parties have become the focus of attending art fairs, creating a void between the audience that is genuinely interested in art and the bogus—and, in some ways, philistine—audience. By using french folds and stock photography, this book tries to convey that void with the exterior of the folds containing hazy collaged banality, and the interior of the folds, which must be ripped open, containing the pertinent writings. The act of ripping open these spreads asks the reader if they are willing to destroy this artistic, yet gaudy, artifact and break down the facade that art fairs have constructed.</p><p><sup>Designed at Pratt Institute</sup></p>

Portraits are converted to embossments so that the age, gender, race, or other characteristics of a person influence the text of the current and previous profiles. At the same time, the embossments acknowledge people for their creativity and accomplishments rather than their age, gender, or color of their skin. The typography is typeset as shifting paragraph blocks, conveying how our competitive human nature&mdash;the challenge to outperform someone different than ourselves, and the shifting discourse of a diverse workforce&mdash;is the science behind how diversity generates creativity within the workplace.</p><p><sup>Designed at Pratt Institute</sup></p>
